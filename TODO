= Filters =
There is only a basic filter available and functionality like
filtercomposition is not implemented yet. It is also not so clear
what the differences between Filters and specific Enumerators is
(except that filters can (should) be more sophisticated.)
-----------

= Overpass JSON Parsing =
OverpassRequest.parse_json() is implemented in a complicated way and
based on assumptions. It probably also leaves room for improvement
from a performance point of view.
-------------------------

= Overpass Request Format = 
OverpassRequest.do() does not support a format other than JSON.
Remove params[:format] completely?
---------------------------

= Backlinks =
Backlink from Node to WayInstance, i.e. answering the question
"Which Way(instance)s is this node part of?". 
See way.rb WayInstance.initialize!
Same for Relation->Node/Way/Relation.
--------------

= Persist Users =
Node./Way./Relation.all_users maybe introduce @users of class Set
and manage users persistently.
