= Enumerators =
There should be a number of specific enumerators calling specific
filter methods for different objects.
----------------

= Filters =
There is only a basic filter available and functionality like
filtercomposition is not implemented yet.
-----------

= Overpass JSON Parsing =
OverpassRequest.parse_json() is implemented in a complicated way and
based on assumptions. It probably also leaves room for improvement
from a performance point of view.
-------------------------

= Overpass Request Format = 
OverpassRequest.do() does not support a format other than JSON.
Remove params[:format] completely?
---------------------------

= Backlinks =
Backlink from Node to WayInstance, i.e. answering the question
"Which Way(instance)s is this node part of?". 
See way.rb WayInstance.initialize!
Same for Relation->Node/Way/Relation.
--------------

= Persist Users =
Node./Way./Relation.all_users maybe introduce @users of class Set
and manage users persistently.
