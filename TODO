= Redundant load_history code =
private load_history(hl) in classes inheriting from OSMObject (e.g. Node,
Way, Relation) have redundant code except for hl.load_for_***(self).
Maybe this can be solved better?
-------------------------------

= HistoryLoader Integration =
HistoryLoader integration in the current architecture.
-----------------------------

= Overpass JSON Parsing =
OverpassRequest.parse_json() is implemented in a complicated way and
based on assumptions. It probably also leaves room for improvement
from a performance point of view.
-------------------------

= Overpass Request Format = 
OverpassRequest.do() does not support a format other than JSON.
Remove params[:format] completely?
---------------------------

= Backlinks =
Backlink from Node to WayInstance, i.e. answering the question
"Which Way(instance)s is this node part of?". 
See way.rb WayInstance.initialize!
Same for Relation->Node/Way/Relation.
--------------

= Persist Users =
Node./Way./Relation.all_users maybe introduce @users of class Set
and manage users persistently.
-----------------

= Inspect =
The use of object_id*2 in inspect is decimal at the moment
-> convert to hex
-----------

= Data Analysis | History Fetch =
After an Overpass API request, compare all OSMObject versions
with their version from the database. If the OSMObject.version is
less than 1 version ahead, everything is fine. If it is not, then
compute how many versions (objects) have to be fetched via the
OSM API until the database version + 1 is reached. 
If a certain threshold is not reached, do the OSM API  history fetch. 
Otherwise use the old complete system state from the database as the 
current version.
----------------------------------


= Enumerators =
Give access to data by means of enumerators rather than arrays / hashes.
---------------

= Filters =
Build in filters.
-----------

= UserLoader.load_tracks untested =
Test UserLoader.load_tracks.
-----------------------------------

= User.name =
User.name is attr_reader atm, but is not set by default.
Either set it to a value when creating new users (sometimes not possible)
or make it a delayed_attr_reader attribute.
