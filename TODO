1. 
Think about introducing a superclass for Node, Way and Relation
such as GeoObject or OSMObject to avoid redundant code such as
in Region.add_node, .add_way and .add_relation. OSMObject can have
attributes shared among Node, Way and Relation classes such as
id, version, history, user, datastore etc. and shared methods such as 
add_to_region or new_from_json.

2.
OverpassRequest.parse_json() is implemented in a complicated way and
based on assumptions. It probably also leaves room for improvement
from a performance point of view.

3.
OverpassRequest.do() does not support a format other than JSON.
Remove params[:format] completely?

4.
Backlink from Node to WayInstance, i.e. answering the question
"Which Way(instance)s is this node part of?". 
See way.rb WayInstance.initialize!
Same for Relation->Node/Way/Relation.

5.
Node./Way./Relation.all_users maybe introduce @users of class Set
and manage users persistently.

6.
The use of object_id*2 in inspect is decimal at the moment
-> convert to hex
